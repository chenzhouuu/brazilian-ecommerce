# Application of Machine Learning Techniques for Supply Chain Optimization

## Description

This project leveraged the machine learning and network analysis in this task to find out bottlenecks in their supply chain network and we provides business insights to small retailers by strategically recommending them to build distribution centers in locations having the highest demand and lowest transportation efficiency. This project also aims to give them an in-depth analysis of those product categories which are highly sold at that location. Revenue analysis was executed throughout the country of Brazil to help small business have an understanding of which aspects should they focus.

This proejct is conducted by me and my fellow colleagues Mit Goda, Avinash Ahuja, Suhas Hurli Gopalakrishna under the guidance of Dr Chris McComb and Dr Binyang Song. The dataset is from Olist Store which can be found at: https://www.kaggle.com/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce. We believe this analysis coupled with key bussiness insights can help samll retailers have a better shot at having greater market penetration at the same time reducing unnecessary costs which are spent on the logistics.
